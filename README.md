Text file viewing program for Amiga. Just a C exercise to me and I wanted to use some new system routines.

Uses Courier 18 font.

## Amiga system needed

This one needs AmigaOS 3.2.x so, that at least version 47 of the following libraries can be opened:

- graphics.library
- intuituin.library
- diskfont.library

## Other stuff

Not quite finished yet. Could be done in better way. Perhaps an alternative version will show up in this repo.

I'm planning to add possibility to change the font and its size.
